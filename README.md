Getting Started and Prerequisites from React Native Docs.

## Getting Started

```
npx react-native run-ios
```


### Prerequisites

#### Node & Watchman
We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:
```
brew install node
brew
```

#### Xcode & CocoaPods
The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 9.4 or newer.install watchman.

Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode
To install a simulator, open Xcode > Preferences... and select the Components tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

CocoaPods
CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use sudo when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
